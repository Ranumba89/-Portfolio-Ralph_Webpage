        Hard work and creativity has been the compass that has navigated and helped me find my true identity and strength. I work best when a business is in need of an innovative idea that will help growth. I do so by embodying the story of the project as it is intended, or I find a way to relate it to my own life. 
My creative talent has finally navigated me to my final destination, which is the coding world. The coding world almost feels god like, meaning, if I can think of it I can breathe it to life, mold it to growth by teaching it how to take its first steps, then coaching it how to run to the finish line. Javascript seems to be my magic clay that I use to mold these ideas into life! With such power it can be used in the frontend and backend of programming. I have been using Javascript to power a sleek website or app design look, while using it to query a quick and complicated data from a database, just to serve a specific functionality in an application or website. 

In actuality the UCLA coding camp sat in the passenger seat and helped navigate me into the coding world. I received my full stack credentials there where I learned new programming techniques. One of the modern techniques I learned from the bootcamp was React.. With the virtual dom, endless creation of components and the jsx functions capabilities React has improved efficiency and accuracy with my codes.
